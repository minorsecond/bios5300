\noindent Although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between
lifestyle risk factors and stroke outcome, few have done so while
controlling as age and race/ethnicity range. Utilizing quasi-binomial
logistic regression, we show that the odds of having had a stroke
increase with being a daily smoker, days of anxiety, and having a
depression diagnosis.

\subsection{Survey Weighting}\label{survey-weighting}}

The BRFSS survey data were weighted using the raking method, which is a
two-part methodology to help insure unbiased results by accounting for
noncoverage and nonresponse bias and forcing the total number of cases
to equal the population estimate of each state in the United States
\citep{CentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention2007}.

\hypertarget{dependent-and-independent-variables}{%
\subsection{Dependent and Independent
Variables}\label{dependent-and-independent-variables}}

The dependent variable, stroke outcome, was recoded to a binary variable
for use in a logistic regression model. Depression diagnosis and heavy
drinker were also recoded into a binary variable. For each variable used
in the analysis, \emph{don't know / unsure} and \emph{refused} responses
were dropped. Table 1 lists the variables included in the model.

A subject was designated as a heavy drinker if they were either an adult
male who reported consuming more than 14 drinks per week or an adult
female who reported consuming more than 7 drinks per week. This value
was calculated after asking the subjects, ``during the past 30 days, on
the days when you drank, about how many drinks did you drink on
average?'' and ``during the past 30 days, how many days per week or
month did you have at least one drink of any alcoholic beverage such as
beer, wine, a malt beverage or liquor?''
\citep{CentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention2007}.

\hypertarget{logistic-regression-model}{%
\subsection{Logistic Regression Model}\label{logistic-regression-model}}

The first model used in calculating the logistic regression utilized the
standard binomial function to predict the log odds of binary outcome
\(k\). The binomial formula, is given as
\[P(k)={n \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k},\] where \(k\) represents a stroke
outcome, \(n\) represents the sample size, and \(p\) is the probability
that a stroke will occur. {[}\textbf{Explain overdispersion}{]} Before
being checked for overdispersion by calculating \(\phi\), given by the
formula
\[\phi = \frac{1}{(n-p-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} -\hat{y} _{i})^{2} 
/ \hat{y} _{i}.\] A threshold of \(\phi > 1\), was used to determine if
the data were overdispersed, possibly leading to unstable estimates. To
account for the overdispersion, \(\phi\) was included as a model
parameter, giving the formula
\[P(X=k)={n \choose k}p(p+k\phi)^{k-1}(1-p-k\phi)^{n-k}.\]

\section{Results}\label{results}}

The weighted number of strokes in the United States in 2016 was
8,020,080, representing approximately 2.5\% of the total 2016 United
States population. Out of these, 3.20\% were female and 3.13\% were
male.

A chi-squared test of independence revealed that the there is not
statistically significant evidence that stroke outcome and sex is
independent from one another at an alpha level of 0.05, \(\chi^2\) (3,
\(N\)=486,303) = 1.73, \(p\)=0.48.

The proportion of subjects who have suffered from a stroke by smoker
status is shown in Table 3, and visually in Figure 2. The percentage of
subjects who have had a stroke is highest for the subjects who smoke
daily, followed by subjects who are former smokers, followed by subjects
who smoke some days. A possible explanation for the lower percentage of
stroke in subjects who smoke some days than subjects who are former
smokers is that stroke victims may simply have ceased smoking after
having a stroke.

The proportions shown in Table 3 are depicted as a mosaic plot in Figure
2. The mosaic plot is a graphical depiction the proportions within each
table cell, shaded by the difference from the expected observation. Blue
depicts a higher than expected number of observations for that cell, and
red depicts a lower than expected number of observations for that cell.
As shown in Figure 2, there were a greater than expected number of
non-smokers that have never had a stroke, and a greater than expected
number of smokers and former smokers who have had a stroke.

Model}\label{logistic-regression-model-1}}

The binomial logistic regression model resulted in a \(\phi\) value of
2.52, indicating that there is overdispersion in the estimates and the
quasi-binomial function should be used instead.

The results of the quasi-binomial logistic regression (Table 4) indicate
that being female is a protective factor (OR = 0.71, 95\% CI = {[}0.51 -
0.98{]}), as well as having an annual household income between \$35,000
and \$75,000 (OR = 0.48, 95\% CI = {[}0.25 - 0.92{]}) or over \$75,000
(OR = 0.41, 95\% CI = {[}0.20 - 0.92{]}).

Monthly days with anxiety, having a depression diagnosis, and age were
all positively associated with greater odds of stroke.For each
additional day heavily affected by anxiety,the odds of having had a
stroke were 1.02 times higher, and for those who have been diagnosed
with depression the odds of stroke were 2.05 times higher. Age had the
strongest relationship to the odds of having had a stroke, with those
aged over 65 years old having 95 times the odds of having had a stroke
diagnosis than those who were between the ages of 18 and 24 years old.

The effect of each significant risk factor, stratified by depression
diagnosis, on the probability of having had a stroke is shown in Figure
2. The probability of a person having a stroke increases with the number
of days a person is significantly affected by anxiety. This probability
is multiplied if a person has been diagnosed with depression. For
non-smokers with no depression diagnosis who did not signifantly suffer
from anxiety, the probability of having had a stroke approaches zero. If
the same subject was diagnosed with depression, the probability of
having had a stroke nears 5\%.

The probability of having had a stroke is multiplied in daily smokers,
beginning at approximately 5\% for daily smokers who have not been
diagnosed with depression nor have suffered from significant anxiety.
With a depression diagnosis, the probability originates at approximately
7\% for subjects with zero days of anxiety and increases to 15\% for
subjects who experienced thirty days of signiticant anxiety. This
relationship is similar for subjects who currently smoke some days.
